# Rust Video Encoder with Hexagonal Architecture

The Rust Video Encoder is a state-of-the-art video encoding solution built using the principles of Hexagonal Architecture. This project combines the robustness of Rust programming language with a modular architectural approach to create a high-performance video encoding application. By adopting a microservice design and integrating seamlessly with Google Cloud Storage, this project offers a comprehensive solution for encoding and managing video content.

## Hexagonal Architecture

The Rust Video Encoder is structured around the Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters. This architectural pattern focuses on decoupling the core business logic from external dependencies. In this context, the core encoding logic is encapsulated within the application's core, while external services such as storage, networking, and API interactions are treated as adapters. This ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the application more maintainable, testable, and adaptable.

## Microservice Design

The Rust Video Encoder is designed as a microservice, aligning with modern software development trends. This microservices approach allows the encoder to function as an independent unit, facilitating scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. Each aspect of video encoding, such as job submission, encoding process management, and result retrieval, is encapsulated within well-defined microservice components. These components can be scaled independently to handle varying workloads.

## Google Cloud Storage Integration

The Rust Video Encoder seamlessly integrates with Google Cloud Storage to provide a robust solution for handling input and output video files. Google Cloud Storage offers scalable and durable object storage with global accessibility. The encoder interacts with Google Cloud Storage to retrieve input videos for encoding and store the resulting encoded videos. This integration ensures reliability, data durability, and optimal performance when dealing with video content.
